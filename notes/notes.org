#+BEGIN_QUOTE
As regards future works, since Petri nets are a formalism
usually far from the way of thinking of a traditional composer,
software tools should be designed and developed to
implement a musician-oriented interface.

** Interview by Aphex Twin with Korg engineer :musician:synth_design:tuning:
cite:_aphex_2017

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Yes, many. For instance, on the Chroma I like holding down one key, pressing
another key and ththing:yo:en tuning the second key in relation to the first,
sometimes making two extremely different frequency combinations, like something
very low and extremely high at the same time and maybe a group of these dual
combos only existing in the top octave of the keyboard map, the rest being
another tuning or multiple tunings, all in one tuning table.

It's something I never saw in anyone else's tunings, combining several
tuning tables within one map, so that's one of my little inventions I guess, as
I rarely used the full range of 127 notes in one tuning within one track.
monologue can tune four notes at a time which we planned. It's a different
approach again and something I look forward to experimenting with more.

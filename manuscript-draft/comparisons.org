# Compare different existing systems

* Criteria
 - Web based :: Does the system work on a modern browser
 - Symbolic rep :: Does the system use symbolic representation or is it more or
                   less a spectrum that you can draw on.
 - Accessibility :: From none to high, is the system accessible. An example of a
                    no accessibility is a system like UPIC which is not
                    accessible to something that is very accessible like web
                    app. Paid software that needs to be installed is in the
                    middle of this spectrum.

Purpose: describe how I'm going about it and why. Describe the tools I'm using.
:END:

** Introduction
** Appraisal of options
    - Availability
    - Usage style - instrument like (Levin)
** Approach - theory
    1. HCI considerations, in particular NUI cite:wigdor_brave_2011 
    2. The Musical Interface Technology Design Space cite:overholt_musical_2009
    3. Research into cross modal perception (time x axis, pitch y axis) - https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280777718_Shape_drawing_and_gesture_Cross-modal_mappings_of_sound_and_music 
    # 3. Avoid inference (e.g. machine learning)
** Approach - practice
    1. Introduction
    2. Delivery on Web Browser
       1. Modern Web Browser as a delivery platform :: discuss pros and cons and situations
           where it is likely to be a good option. I.e. prototyping where feedback
           is important. Disadvantages performance, can't be used with pro audio
           software such as ASIO. cite:adenot_web_2017 
       2. Benefits of using Tone.js cite:mann_interactive_2015
       3. Paper.js for the graphics system
          - Scenegraph
          - Line smoothing
          - Vector system
    3. FM synthesis :: Give a brief overview of FM synthesis and why it was a
                       good choice for the application
    4. Live coding workflow
       1. Introduction
          - The morphic interface
          - Mention precedents such as smalltalk squeek
            # - Alan Kay Steve Jobs story??? - cite:kay_what_2017 
       2. React.js framework to allow for a declaritive programming model as well
         as a live code reloading workflow
       3. Clojurescript
          1. Relationship to clojure
          2. Benefits of using clojurescript
             1. Immutable data structures (Binary tree)
             2. Functional programming paradigm
             3. Live code reloading (particularly when used in conjunction with
               react.js)
       4. Managing state with Re-frame
          - Describe programming model
          - It's relationship to FRP
** Conclusion

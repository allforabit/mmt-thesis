* Conclusion and further work
** Summary of work completed
** Broader implications of development
:NOTES:
- Incorporate ideas into DAWs (move away from tracks and mixers)
- Methodology used very successful for prototyping (delivery on web platform,
  live code reloading)
:END:
** Future work
*** Performance improvements
:NOTES:
- Try different audio engines, in particular wasm based
- Move graphics to GPU based system
:END:
*** Broaden visual language
:NOTES:
- Incorporate and visualize more control data
:END:
*** Allow for larger structures
:NOTES:
- Perhaps by scrolling
- Or multiple canvases/scenes
- "Smart brushes" that would draw arpeggios, or similar generative structures
:END:
*** 3D spaces, VR, spatial audio

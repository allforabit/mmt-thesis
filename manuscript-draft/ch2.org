* Background to study
:NOTES:
Purpose: establish the dominant analog DAW metaphors and broad approaches and tools in use.

** Introduction
    - Introduce what will be discussed in this section
    - A brief historical perspective
** The idea generation stage of music production
    - Introduction :: Give an overview of different stages of music production
                       as outlined in cite:duignan_computer_2008 and end with
                       focus on the initial idea generation
    - Using an instrument
    - Scoring software
    - Quirky music tools such as "Loopy"
    - Most commonly in electronic music, DAWS
** Discussion of DAW Metaphors
    1. Introduction
    2. Piano roll
    3. Mixing console
    4. Plugins
** Discussion of more open systems
    1. Introduction
    2. Textual programming systems
       - Supercollider
       - Csound
       - Commonmusic
       - Nyquist
       - Chuck
    3. Graphical programming systems
       - Max MSP
       - Pure data
       - Ircam Open music
       - Plogue Bidule
       - Jeskola Buzz
** Music in the browser: a new frontier
Discuss drum machines, etc available on the web. Note the accessibility that
they provide. Perhaps introduce tone.js here.
** Conclusion
While the dominant metaphors used in DAWs have their uses they can lead to
limitations in the creative process particularly at the early stage of ideas
creation. More open system give too much power and impede the creative process.

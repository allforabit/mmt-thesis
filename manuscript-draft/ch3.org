** Introduction
** Sonic sketching from a historical perspective
    1. Visual music
       1. Oskar Fischinger
       2. Fantasia
    2. Legacy synth systems
       1. Oramics
       2. UPIC
       3. ANS synth
** Sonic sketching in the twenty first century
    1. Golan Levin cite:levin_painterly_2000 
    2. Music animation machine cite:malinowski_music_2017
    3. SonicPainter by William Coleman cite:coleman_sonicpainter:_2015 
    4. Fischinger google doodle
** Alternative music systems on the web
 1. Pink trombone - https://dood.al/pinktrombone/
 2. Tonehack
 3. Auraglyph (although not web based)
 4. http://arthurcarabott.com/mui-envelope/
** Summary of currently available music creation systems 
(Note that UPIC style sketch synths are not available online)
** Conclusion 
Both the twentieth and twenty first century have seen a great deal of
experimentation with ideas of visualizing music and sketching. The audio
processing capabilities available in modern browsers offers an opportunity to
explore and refine less mainstream music creation metaphors.
